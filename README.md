## My process
I tried to follow Frontend Mentor recomandations. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I practiced more grid, flexbox and HTML semantics. Still struggling with responsive design as I tend to design "pixel perfect".

### Continued development

As I learn to develop practical projects I better understand CSS rules and things start to make more sense. This is motivating me to keep going. I want to continue doing these challenges and get exposed to different situations with increased complexity. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - I always come back to this article when I struggle to center horrizontally or vertically.

- [Frontend Mentor Articles](https://www.frontendmentor.io/articles/a-practical-guide-to-responsive-web-design-3mFeo4HklJ) - This is an amazing article (+video) which helped me understand responsive design beyond media query.
